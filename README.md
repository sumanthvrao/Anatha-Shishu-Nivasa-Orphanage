# Summary

Build a secure and practical Database management System for an orphanage "Anatha Shishu Navasa" based in Basavanagudi, Bangalore to help them manage donations (both cash and in-kind), adoption details, children details - all of which were previously recorded on books and excel sheets. PostgreSQL database with a PHP backend was used to implement the database. An easy to use frontend was provided for data entry and query by the administration team.
